# SRM-Companion
A simple Android app made for the SRM University students which stores their daily schedule and students can view them, All the events and announcements made by the University can also be viewed by the app.

Using firebase to authenticate users and storing their timetable in firebase database, when signing out all data is destroyed, so that another user can sign in to view his/her timetable. Firebase UI is used to sign in using Google and Email.

The app fetches college's day order from a firebase database, that i have made, and other algorithms to made the app dyanamic and responsive.
